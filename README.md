# Steam-Account-generator BETA
Generate multiple Steam accounts quickly and easily with Steam-Account-generator BETA, a Python program that uses Selenium to create accounts with custom domains, custom email addresses, or input from an external CSV file.

## Core Features
* Generate accounts from an external CSV file
* Generate accounts on your custom domain
* Generate a new account each time

## Getting Started
A tutorial video **how to setup the program --->** [tutorial](https://youtu.be/i42OlgQqjr8).
Follow these steps to get started with Steam-Account-generator BETA:

1. Download the program from GitHub
2. Download the latest stable version of [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) **Check Important**
3. Unpack Chromedriver to your program location folder
4. Run the program and start generating accounts

## Important 17.09
If you are using **chrome version 116** and above, you no longer need to download [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/).
With **chrome version 116 and above, make sure you have Selenium 4.12 installed**.
I will delete this section in 2 weeks and update my tutorial video.
